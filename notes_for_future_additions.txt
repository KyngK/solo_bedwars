- USE @a AND SCOREBOARD VALUES
- Use nbt tags/possibly redstone to load all maps
- 23 maps - USE CUSTOM DIMENSIONS :D
- Custom height limit may be able to be changed using datapacks - although a lot of this is map specific
- How to make player hidden from tab when they die?
- Log skins - maybe when the player breaks a block raycast to the block, then detect all items there? Otherwise just replace that type of wood in their inventory... or just don't do log skins at all
- For fireballs most likely just use a remodeled carrot on a stick, since everything else is not ideal. Only one right click item anyway (reddit.com/r/minecraftcommands/wiki/questions/itemclick)

MAP SPECIFIC ITEMS:

- Height limit
- Generator placement and player positions (for splitting)
- Block limit (how far out you can place blocks)
- Spawnpoint (where you spawn in the cage may not change, but when the game starts)
- Spectator placement??
- Generator speeds



PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- Make a real load function
- Make a scoreboard
- Make a folder for each map (maybe just one now then duplicate later)
- Make a join function
  - In the join function there needs to be a command that teleports them to a dimension (MAKE THIS). Use speedway for testing but I think hollow should be default map
  - Spawns player in the cage, with the player counter
- Start system
  - Create a custom scoreboard system
  - Uses normal bedwars start system, but give the original players an option to force start the game, as well as admin score or something? Copy from pkbd
  - When game starts assign teams FIRST then teleport to bases so ADD TEAMS!!
  - Give some tags, and work on compass system LATER
- Add fighting system, bed break system, final kill system, death system, systems galore :D
- Add generators. Make them cap at a certain amount of resources so maybe only execute if scoreboard cap for that entity is 0, as well as multiple titles for Diamond/Emerald, with different tiers
  - Cap system can be done by spawning if the scoreboard is at a certain value, (ex. 200 ticks) for 10s, then when it spawns increase a cap scoreboard by 1,
  and when it reaches x value, just stop spawning/set scoreboard cap value for that entity to 0
  - Test on hypixel for actual speeds - and splitting mechanisms
  - Add splitting (test this)! I think that splitting is just giving the other players in the gen same amount as the other player is. Can be done by
  checking if a player obtains that item on that specific team, then giving that item to the other players on the team that are in the generator. Generator
  position detecting/detecting if they are in the generator can be done using predicates
  - Use the liked video about animated generators for more info
  - Add generator tiers, for different spawning times etc.
- Add block limits, test this on Hypixel. Test block limits in all directions
- Add shops (!) This is going to take a while, probably just use a chest minecart that's disguised and then make it into a custom gui (DO DIAMOND SHOP FIRST, because
some items have different attributes that are modified by diamond shop and therefore they should be done first)
  - Bridge egg is simple however take into account build limits
- Test size of different methods of custom shops so the best is used I suppose. This is going to be the hardest part is my guess
  - Add all items
  - Fireballs are remodeled carrots on sticks because... well it's hard to do other methods
  - Bedbug is... well a modified snowball this can be figured out as well
- Add team/ender chests. Ender chests easy af but team chests not so much
- Modify tnt/fireball kb
- Custom fall damage??? Test if this is actually a thing on hypixel
- CUSTOMIZATION
 - Add all customizations, which include (check this list):
  - Particle trails, bed break effects, final kill effects, death sounds, particle trails, victory dances (DO THESE AFTER DONE), log skins, and shopkeeper skins
- Add events system (over time the game progresses with different events like gen tiers etc.
  - Add dragons with custom names of dragons, make custom targets. etc... until game end
